### Files

There are 4 files that interact with each other.

1. getData.py - Retrieves the data from the Marvel API using marvelous
2. marvelTypes.py - Has all the types being used for queries
3. schema.py - Has the root query that creates the queries and resolvers
4. server.py - Has the flask code needed to run the graphql interface to type queries
